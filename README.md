# Beamer Template

The Beamer (LaTeX slideshow) template that I built and hope to someday use.
IMHO it's pretty nifty.

The base template is Boadilla.
The colours are inspired by Monokai.

There is macros that let you switch all the off-whites with the dark greys
in order to switch between a "dark theme" and "light theme".
